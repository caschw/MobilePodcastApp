# MobilePodcastApp

The easiest cross-platform podcast app template.

A cross-platform podcast app that integrates feeds from blog, and podcast RSS. Completely and 100% configurable from a single file. Re-brand as your own in minutes and get all supported apps with full functionality.

Here is the vision. You have a podcast, and you want to have a top notch app on all of the major platforms (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone). The thing is, podcast apps have a lot of common functionality. At the [MS Dev Show](http://msdevshow), we're all about sharing. That's why we decided to create an application template that allows you to **easily** set your logo, RSS feed, etc., and get a top-notch app for your podcast.
